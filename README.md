# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

I made this project to put my skills in JavaScript to the test. This is my first project using JavaScript and I wanted to see my website's dynamism. My website prompts the user to add employees of their choice and calculate their payroll based on their given salary. The website then stops running once the user decides to stop adding employees to the payroll.
